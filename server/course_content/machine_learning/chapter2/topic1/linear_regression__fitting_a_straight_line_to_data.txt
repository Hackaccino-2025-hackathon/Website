    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Linear Regression: Fitting a Straight Line to Data</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.  The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line that minimizes the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the line.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Simple Linear Regression</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable.  The equation of the line is represented as:</p>
<pre class="bg-gray-200 p-2 rounded-md mb-4">
<code class="text-sm font-mono">y = mx + c</code>
</pre>
    <p class="mb-4">Where:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><code>y</code> is the dependent variable</li>
        <li><code>x</code> is the independent variable</li>
        <li><code>m</code> is the slope of the line (representing the change in <code>y</code> for a unit change in <code>x</code>)</li>
        <li><code>c</code> is the y-intercept (the value of <code>y</code> when <code>x</code> is 0)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">The slope and intercept are estimated from the data using methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values of <code>y</code>.  This line of best fit can then be used to predict the value of <code>y</code> for a given <code>x</code>.  Simple linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning the change in <code>y</code> is constant for any change in <code>x</code>.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Multiple linear regression extends this concept to multiple independent variables. The equation becomes:</p>
 <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-2 rounded-md mb-4">
<code class="text-sm font-mono">y = m1x1 + m2x2 + ... + mnxn + c</code>
</pre>   
    <p class="mb-4">Where:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><code>x1, x2, ..., xn</code> are the independent variables</li>
        <li><code>m1, m2, ..., mn</code> are the corresponding coefficients (slopes) representing the effect of each independent variable on <code>y</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">Multiple linear regression allows for modeling more complex relationships where the dependent variable is influenced by several factors.  Interpretation of the coefficients becomes crucial, as each coefficient represents the change in <code>y</code> associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.  Key assumptions include linearity, independence of errors, constant variance of errors (homoscedasticity), and normality of errors.  Violations of these assumptions can affect the reliability of the model.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Applications of Linear Regression</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Linear Regression finds applications in various fields including:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Finance (predicting stock prices)</li>
        <li>Economics (analyzing the impact of economic policies)</li>
        <li>Marketing (understanding customer behavior)</li>
        <li>Healthcare (predicting patient outcomes)</li>
    </ul>
