    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Random Forest Algorithm in Machine Learning</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It leverages the wisdom of multiple decision trees to make more accurate and robust predictions compared to individual trees.  The algorithm's strength lies in its ability to handle complex datasets, missing data, and prevent overfitting.</p>


    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding the Intuition</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">The core idea behind Random Forest is to build a collection of decision trees, each trained on a slightly different subset of the data and features. This diversity among trees ensures that the model captures various aspects of the data and is less susceptible to biases or noise present in individual trees.  The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all individual trees, either through majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).</p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Key Features</h1>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Handles Missing Data:  Robust to missing values, reducing the need for imputation.</li>
        <li>Feature Importance:  Ranks features by their contribution to predictions, enabling feature selection.</li>
        <li>Scalability:  Performs well on large datasets without significant performance degradation.</li>
        <li>Versatility:  Applicable to both classification and regression tasks.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Random Forest Works</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">The Random Forest algorithm operates in the following steps:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging): Random subsets of the training data are created with replacement (meaning some data points might be repeated in a subset).</li>
        <li>Feature Randomness: For each tree at each node, a random subset of features is considered for splitting. </li>
        <li>Tree Construction:  Each tree is trained on its corresponding data subset and feature subset, growing independently.</li>
        <li>Prediction Aggregation:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Classification: The final prediction is the class voted by the majority of the trees.</li>
                <li>Regression: The final prediction is the average of the predictions from all trees.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Assumptions</h1>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Independent Tree Predictions: Each tree makes its own predictions without influence from other trees.</li>
        <li>Data Randomness:  The use of random data subsets and feature subsets is crucial.</li>
        <li>Sufficient Data: Enough data is required to create diverse trees.</li>
        <li>Ensemble Improvement: The combined predictions are more accurate than individual tree predictions.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Implementation</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Random Forest can be readily implemented using popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn in Python or the randomForest package in R. Example code snippets for classification and regression tasks are shown below (using scikit-learn in Python):</p>


    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
        <pre class="text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code class="language-python">
# Classification
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2) # Splitting the data

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100) # Initializing the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train) # Training the model
predictions = clf.predict(X_test) # Predicting on the test set

        </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
        <pre class="text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code class="language-python">
