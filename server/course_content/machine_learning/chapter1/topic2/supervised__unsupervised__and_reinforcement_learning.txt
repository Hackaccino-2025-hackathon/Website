    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Machine Learning Paradigms</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Supervised learning is a paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning the training dataset includes both input features and the corresponding correct output values.  This allows the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs and make predictions on new, unseen data. The goal is to generalize from the training data to accurately predict the output for any valid input.  Think of it like a teacher supervising a student, providing the correct answers and guiding the learning process.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Supervised learning is commonly used for two main types of problems:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Predicting a categorical output, such as classifying emails as spam or not spam.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Predicting a continuous output, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">Popular algorithms used in supervised learning include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
        <li>Decision Trees</li>
        <li>Neural Networks</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Unsupervised Learning</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, meaning the training dataset only contains input features without corresponding output values.  The algorithm's goal is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without any prior guidance. This can involve grouping similar data points together (clustering), reducing the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information, or learning the underlying probability distribution of the data.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Common unsupervised learning tasks include:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
    <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouping similar data points together, like customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Reducing the number of variables in a dataset while preserving important information, often used for visualization or as a preprocessing step for supervised learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Association Rule Learning:</strong> Discovering relationships between variables in large datasets, such as finding items frequently bought together in market basket analysis.</li>
</ul>    
<p class="mb-4">Key algorithms in unsupervised learning include:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
    <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
    <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
    <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
    <li>Autoencoders</li>
</ul>


    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment. The agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  The goal is to learn an optimal policy, which is a strategy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.  Unlike supervised learning, there is no explicit "correct" output; the agent learns through trial and error by exploring the environment and adjusting its behavior based on the feedback received.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Reinforcement learning is used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
    <li><strong>Game AI:</strong> Training agents to play games like chess or Go at superhuman levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Controlling robots to perform complex tasks in real-world environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Optimizing resource allocation in areas like traffic control or energy grids.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4">Common reinforcement learning algorithms include:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
    <li>Q-learning</li>
    <li>SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)</li>
    <li>Deep Q-Networks (DQN)</li>
</ul>
