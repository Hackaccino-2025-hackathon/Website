    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Machine Learning Algorithms Overview</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. They are categorized into three main types:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms learn from labeled data (input-output pairs). </li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms find patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Algorithms learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Supervised Learning Algorithms</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">These algorithms learn from labeled data to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.  Some popular algorithms include:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Linear Regression:</p>
            <p>Predicts a continuous target variable based on a linear relationship with input features.  Uses the "least squares" method to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.  Example: predicting house prices based on size.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Logistic Regression:</p>
            <p>Predicts the probability of a categorical outcome. Uses a logistic function (S-shaped curve) to model the relationship between input features and class probabilities. Example: predicting whether a customer will click on an ad.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Decision Trees:</p>
            <p>Creates a tree-like model to make decisions based on a series of feature splits.  Easy to interpret and visualize.  Example: classifying loan applications based on credit score and income.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Support Vector Machines (SVM):</p>
            <p>Finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes.  Can handle complex, non-linear relationships using kernel functions. Example: image classification.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):</p>
            <p>Classifies new data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors in the training data. Example: recommending similar products based on user preferences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Naive Bayes:</p>
            <p>A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. Assumes that features are independent, which simplifies calculations. Example: spam filtering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Random Forest:</p>
            <p>An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.  Example: fraud detection.</p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Gradient Boosting:</p>
            <p>An ensemble method that sequentially builds decision trees, where each tree corrects the errors of its predecessors. Popular implementations include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Example: predicting customer churn.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Neural Networks:</p>
            <p>Complex models inspired by the human brain.  Can learn intricate patterns from data. Example: image recognition, natural language processing.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">These algorithms work with unlabeled data to discover hidden structures or groupings.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Clustering:</p>
            <p>Groups similar data points together.  Examples include K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.  Used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Dimensionality Reduction:</p>
            <p>Reduces the number of variables in a dataset while preserving important information.  Examples include PCA and t-SNE.  Used for feature extraction and visualization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Association Rule Mining:</p>
            <p>Discovers relationships between variables in large datasets.  Example: market basket analysis (finding items frequently bought together).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">These algorithms learn through interaction with an environment.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Q-learning:</p>
            <p>Learns an optimal action-selection policy.  Used in robotics and game playing.</p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <p class="font-bold">SARSA:</p>
            <p>An on-policy algorithm that learns the optimal action-selection policy while following it.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="font-bold">Monte Carlo methods:</p>
            <p>Use random sampling to estimate values or policies.  </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
