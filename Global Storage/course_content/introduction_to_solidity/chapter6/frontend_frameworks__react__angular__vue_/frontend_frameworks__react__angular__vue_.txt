    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Frontend Frameworks Comparison: React, Angular, and Vue.js</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Choosing the right frontend framework is a crucial decision for any web development project.  This comprehensive comparison dives into the strengths and weaknesses of three leading contenders: React, Angular, and Vue.js. We'll explore their popularity, developer satisfaction, performance, features, and overall ecosystem to help you make an informed choice.</p>


    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Popularity and Trends</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Understanding the current popularity and trends of frontend frameworks can provide insights into community support, available resources, and long-term viability.  Several surveys and data sources offer perspectives on framework usage:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Stack Overflow Surveys:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Stack Overflow's annual developer surveys consistently rank React as the most popular frontend framework, followed by Angular and then Vue.js.  However, it's important to note that "popularity" can encompass various aspects, including usage, desire to learn, and admiration.</p>
            <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto">
                <code class="language-text">
                    // Example Stack Overflow Survey Data (2023 - hypothetical)
                    Popularity: React 45%, Angular 18%, Vue.js 16%
                    Desired: React 35%, Vue.js 17%, Angular 14%
                    Admired: Svelte 73%, Solid.js 68%, React 63%
                </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">StateOfJS Survey:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">StateOfJS provides detailed insights into framework usage, satisfaction, and awareness.  Their data often reveals higher satisfaction rates for Svelte and Solid.js, even though their overall usage might be lower than React, Angular, or Vue.js.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">JetBrains Survey:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">JetBrains also conducts developer surveys, offering another data point on framework preferences and usage patterns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">NPM Downloads:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Analyzing NPM download statistics can give a sense of the relative usage of different frameworks, although raw download numbers don't tell the whole story (e.g., a single large project could skew the numbers).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">GitHub Stars:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">While not a direct measure of usage, GitHub stars can indicate community interest and engagement.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Core Features and Architecture</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Each framework has a distinct approach to building user interfaces:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">React:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">React is a component-based library focused on building user interfaces. It utilizes a virtual DOM for efficient updates and JSX for declarative syntax. React is known for its flexibility and large ecosystem.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Angular:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Angular is a full-fledged framework with a strong emphasis on TypeScript and dependency injection.  It provides a structured approach to building complex applications with features like routing, state management, and form handling built-in.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Vue.js:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Vue.js is a progressive framework that's easy to learn and integrate into existing projects. It offers a flexible templating system and reactive data binding.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
