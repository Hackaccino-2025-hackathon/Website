    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Blockchain Forensics: A Deep Dive</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable nature, presents unique challenges and opportunities for forensic investigations. This comprehensive guide explores the intricacies of blockchain forensics, covering its fundamental concepts, methodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions. </p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction to Blockchain Forensics</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Blockchain forensics is the application of digital forensic techniques to investigate and analyze data stored on a blockchain.  The transparent and auditable nature of blockchain transactions provides a rich source of information for investigators, but the pseudonymous nature of users and the complexity of the technology require specialized skills and tools. </p>

    <p class="mb-4">This review aims to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
        <li>Analyze state-of-the-art research in blockchain forensics.</li>
        <li>Identify various digital forensic investigation frameworks and methodologies.</li>
        <li>Explore applications of blockchain forensics across different domains.</li>
        <li>Highlight legal and regulatory challenges.</li>
        <li>Discuss open issues and future research directions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. An Overview of Blockchain Forensics</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Traditional digital forensics follows a standard process:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
        <li><b>Identification:</b> Recognizing relevant digital evidence.</li>
        <li><b>Collection:</b> Gathering evidence systematically.</li>
        <li><b>Extraction:</b> Retrieving data from devices.</li>
        <li><b>Analysis:</b> Examining data for meaningful information.</li>
        <li><b>Examination:</b> Scrutinizing evidence features.</li>
        <li><b>Report:</b> Compiling findings.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="mb-4">Blockchain forensics adapts this process:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
        <li><b>Identification:</b> Identifying relevant blockchain data (addresses, transactions, smart contracts).</li>
        <li><b>Collection:</b> Gathering data from the blockchain (blocks, transactions).</li>
        <li><b>Preservation:</b> Maintaining data integrity (hashing, secure storage).</li>
        <li><b>Analysis:</b> Exploring data for patterns and relationships (transaction tracking, address linking).</li>
        <li><b>Examination:</b> Contextualizing findings with external data (IP logs, financial records).</li>
        <li><b>Report:</b> Compiling findings for legal or regulatory purposes.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">3. Research Methodology</h1>
