    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Machine Learning Algorithms Overview</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. They are categorized based on how they learn:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms learn from labeled data, where the input-output relationship is known.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Algorithms work with unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Supervised Learning Algorithms</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Supervised learning algorithms predict outcomes based on labeled training data. Here are some common algorithms:</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. Linear Regression</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Predicts a continuous target variable based on a linear relationship with input features. Uses least squares to minimize the difference between actual and predicted values.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting house prices based on size.</p>
    <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
        <code class="text-sm">
# Python example using scikit-learn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. Logistic Regression</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Predicts the probability of a categorical outcome using a logistic function. Used for binary or multi-class classification.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting whether a customer will click on an ad.</p>
    <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
        <code class="text-sm">
# Python example using scikit-learn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. Decision Trees</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Builds a tree-like model to make decisions based on feature values. Each node represents a feature, and each branch represents a decision based on that feature.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Example:</strong> Classifying emails as spam or not spam.</p>


    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes. Can handle linear and non-linear classification using kernel functions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.  The distance metric used to determine "nearest" can be Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, etc. </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">6. Naive Bayes</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Classifies data points based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence.  Often used for text classification.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">7. Random Forest</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">8. Gradient Boosting</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">An ensemble method that sequentially builds trees, where each tree corrects the errors of its predecessors. Examples include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.</p>


    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">9. Neural Networks (Including Multilayer Perceptron)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Complex models inspired by the human brain, capable of learning intricate patterns from data.  Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are a common type.</p>


    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">Unsupervised learning algorithms discover patterns in unlabeled data. Here are some key algorithms:</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. Clustering</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Groups similar data points together into clusters. Common algorithms include K-Means, K-Means++, K-Mode, Fuzzy C-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative, Divisive), DBSCAN, and OPTICS. </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. Dimensionality Reduction</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Reduces the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information.  Techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Autoencoders.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. Association Rule Mining</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Discovers relationships between variables in large datasets. Common algorithms include Apriori, FP-Growth, and ECLAT.</p>



    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">Reinforcement learning algorithms learn through interaction with an environment. Key categories include:</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. Model-Based Methods</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">These methods learn a model of the environment and use it to plan actions. Examples include Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the Bellman equation, Value Iteration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. Model-Free Methods</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">These methods learn directly from experience without building a model. Examples include Q-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo methods, REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, and A3C.</p>
