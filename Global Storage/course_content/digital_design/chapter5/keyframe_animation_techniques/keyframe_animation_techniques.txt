    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Keyframe Animation Techniques</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Keyframe animation is a technique used in computer graphics and animation to create movement and change over time.  It involves specifying the values of an object's properties at certain points in time, called keyframes. The software then automatically calculates the values for the frames between the keyframes, creating a smooth transition.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is Keyframe Animation?</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Keyframe animation is a method in animation where you define specific points in time (keyframes) and set the properties of an object, like position, rotation, scale, color, etc., at those points. The animation software then interpolates the values between these keyframes to create smooth motion.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How Does Keyframe Animation Work?</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">The process begins by setting keyframes at specific points in time along a timeline.  At each keyframe, the animator defines the desired state of the object being animated. The animation software then fills in the gaps between these keyframes through a process called interpolation. This creates the illusion of smooth, continuous motion.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Types of Interpolation</h1>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><p class="mb-2"><b>Linear Interpolation:</b> This method creates a straight-line path between keyframes, resulting in uniform motion. It's simple to implement but can look mechanical and unnatural for complex movements.</p>
        <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <pre class="text-sm font-mono">
// Example of linear interpolation between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) at time t (0 <= t <= 1)
x = x1 + (x2 - x1) * t;
y = y1 + (y2 - y1) * t;
            </pre>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li><p class="mb-2"><b>Bezier Interpolation:</b> This method uses Bezier curves to create smoother, more natural-looking motion. The curves offer more control over the acceleration and deceleration of the animation, allowing for more dynamic and nuanced movements.</p>
          <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <pre class="text-sm font-mono">
// Example of quadratic Bezier curve with control points P0, P1, and P2 at time t (0 <= t <= 1)
P = (1-t)^2 * P0 + 2 * (1-t) * t * P1 + t^2 * P2;
            </pre>
          </div>

        </li>
        <li><p class="mb-2"><b>Spline Interpolation:</b> This method uses mathematical functions called splines to generate smooth curves that pass through multiple keyframes. Spline interpolation provides even finer control over the animation path, making it suitable for complex, organic movements.</p>
          <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <pre class="text-sm font-mono">
// Implementing spline interpolation often involves libraries or specialized functions depending on the spline type (e.g., Catmull-Rom, B-spline).
            </pre>
          </div>

        </li>
    </ul>
