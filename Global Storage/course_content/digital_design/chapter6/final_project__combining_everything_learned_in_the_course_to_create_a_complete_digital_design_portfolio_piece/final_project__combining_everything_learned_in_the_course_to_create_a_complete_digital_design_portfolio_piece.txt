    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Portfolio Project Development</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">A strong portfolio is crucial for showcasing design skills and attracting potential clients or employers. This section breaks down the key stages of portfolio project development.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Project Ideation and Selection</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Begin by brainstorming project ideas that align with your skills and interests. Consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Target Audience: Who are you designing for?</li>
        <li>Problem Solving: What problem does your project address?</li>
        <li>Skill Demonstration: What skills do you want to showcase?</li>
        <li>Originality: How can you make your project stand out?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Structuring the Project</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A well-structured project demonstrates organization and professionalism.  Consider these phases:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Planning: Define the scope, goals, and deliverables of your project.</li>
        <li>Design: Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to visualize your design.</li>
        <li>Development (if applicable): Implement the design using appropriate tools and technologies.</li>
        <li>Testing & Refinement: Gather feedback and iterate on your design based on user testing.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Seeking Feedback and Iteration</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Feedback is essential for improving your work. Share your project with peers, mentors, or online communities for constructive criticism.  Don't be afraid to iterate on your design based on the feedback received.  This iterative process is crucial for creating polished and impactful projects.</p>


    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Example Projects</h1>
