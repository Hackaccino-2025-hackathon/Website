            // Example of moving an object in Unity
            using UnityEngine;

            public class MoveObject : MonoBehaviour
            {
                public float speed = 5f;

                void Update()
                {
                    float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
                    float verticalInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

                    Vector3 movement = new Vector3(horizontalInput, 0f, verticalInput);
                    transform.Translate(movement * speed * Time.deltaTime);
                }
            }

This expanded version provides significantly more detail about each game engine, including example code snippets and a more in-depth discussion of the factors to consider when choosing an engine.  It fulfills the requirement for a more comprehensive explanation and a word count closer to the requested range. Remember to adjust the styling and content further to perfectly match your needs.  The Blueprint visual scripting example for Unreal Engine is described conceptually, as embedding actual Blueprint images would require more complex HTML and potentially JavaScript.  You might consider including screenshots of Blueprint examples for clarity.
